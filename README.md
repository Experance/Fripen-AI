# *Fripen* Fruit Ripeness Detector

Built with a handy CV Web Scaffold (but the website almost completely written from scratch), this website holds a model which can detect fruit ripeness for apples (specifically ripe red apples vs green unripe apples), bananas, and blueberries. (Scaffold here: [Github](https://github.com/organization-x/omni/tree/omni_cv))


Made in 3 weeks from ground zero to ground hero ðŸ˜† @AICamp 

### How To Use
***

Go to our website [here](https://experance.github.io/Fripen-AI/app/templates/home.html).

(Edit) Unfortunately, due to the current environment (github pages) being static, flask does not work, and thus the AI can't run and look through images. Also, there are some resizing issues as well. But normally....
Click on "Click to test fruit" and upload an image of a banana, apple, or blueberry. Our pretrained model will then detect the fruit 
and it's level of ripeness.
