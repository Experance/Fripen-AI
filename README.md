# *Fripen* Fruit Ripeness Detector

Built with a handy CV Web Scaffold (but the website almost completely written from scratch), this website holds a model which can detect fruit ripeness for apples (specifically ripe red apples vs green unripe apples), bananas, and blueberries. (Scaffold here: [Github](https://github.com/organization-x/omni/tree/omni_cv))


Made in 3 weeks from ground zero to ground hero ðŸ˜† @AICamp 

### How To Use
***

Go to our website [here](https://cocalc19.ai-camp.dev/1f5857f2-6682-4940-8a34-bfeaf3edb175/port/12345/).

Click on "Click to test fruit" and upload an image of a banana, apple, or blueberry. Our pretrained model will then detect the fruit and it's level of ripeness.
